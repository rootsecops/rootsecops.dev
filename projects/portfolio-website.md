This is the very website you are looking at! It serves as a central hub for my projects, blog posts, and professional background.

### Key Features:

- **AI-Powered Development:** A significant portion of this site was bootstrapped and iterated upon using an AI coding assistant in Firebase Studio, showcasing a modern, collaborative development workflow.
- **Dynamic Content:** Both the blog and project sections are powered by markdown files stored in a private GitHub repository. This acts as a headless CMS, allowing for easy content updates via a simple `git push`.
- **Responsive Design:** Styled with Tailwind CSS for a mobile-first, responsive experience across all devices.
- **Static Generation:** Built with Next.js, leveraging Static Site Generation (SSG) for optimal performance and SEO.
